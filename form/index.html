                <p class="lead">You can help us keep our beaches clean, while enjoying them!</p>

                <p> The United Nations Environment Programme estimated in 2006 that every square
                    mile of ocean contains 46,000 pieces of floating plastic. Once discarded, plastics
                    are weathered and eroded into very small fragments known as micro-plastics. These
                    together with plastic pellets are already found in most beaches around the world.
                    Also, plastic debris causes the deaths of more than a million seabirds every year,
                    as well as more than 100,000 marine mammals.  Plastic materials and other litter 
                    can become concentrated in certain areas called gyres as a result of marine 
                    pollution gathered by oceanic currents. There are now 5 gyres in our ocean. </p>       
                                      
                    
                <p> According to a new analysis published in 2018 by researchers in South Korea and Greenpeace East Asia,
                    microplastics is in 90 percent of the table salt brands sampled worldwide.
                    Thirty-nine salt brands were tested and thirty-six had microplastics in them. </p>

                <p>The beach is beautiful, but it doesn't sustain itself! We need to do our part.
                   The goal is responsible pleasure.  If we don't take care of the things that bring us pleasure,
                   they won't be there for us in the future.
                </p>
